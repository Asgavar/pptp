- clean up -T errors in pptp-command,

23rd December 2000

Things to do:
  Autoconf/automake this beastie.
  Fix do_gre_copy semantics to properly handle multiple calls.
   Like the call manager, there should only be one gre-copy process
   per connection.  This process needs to funnel packets to different
   output tty's, though, depending on the call-id embedded in the
   GRE encapsulation.  pptp.c must then be modified to use an
   already-existing gre-copy process in the same way it uses an
   already-existing call manager.
  Support server operation.
   Obviously, this is more process trickery.  Upon receiving a call
   request, the call manager must automagically launch new gre/pppd
   processes to handle it.  Also, some portions of the server control
   protocol in pptp_ctrl.c have not been completely implemented.
  More flexible configuration system.
   pptp needs to read in config options from /etc/pptp or somesuch.
   This is very necessary for server operation, since presumably we
   will want to limit the hosts we give PPTP access to.  Maybe not,
   though.  We could allow everyone and then allow pppd to do the
   access control.
