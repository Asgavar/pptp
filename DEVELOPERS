Developers Information

You may send patches by e-mail, direct or to the mailing list, or if
you have CVS commit rights, you may use them.

Developers have permission (and encouragement) to adjust more than the
file that they are submitting.  Other files that may be adjusted are:

ChangeLog
	documentation of changes at the code level.

NEWS
	a history of changes as far as an end user is concerned.

AUTHORS
	a list of people who want credit for contributions.

TODO
	a list of things yet to be done.

See section two of Eric Raymond's Software Release Practice HOWTO for
some useful information on good patching practice.

CVS Tags.

There are two types of tags.  Upstream source and release tags.

Upstream source tags are set by the person who brings in the upstream
version of ppp or ppp-mppe, and are not expected to move.  This is
because we are not the authoritative maintainer for those two
packages; we're just generating a package ourselves.

Upstream source tags at the moment are

	openssl-0_9_6
	openssl-mppe-0_9_6
	ppp-2_4_0
	ppp-2_4_1
	ppp-mppe-2_4_0
	ppp-mppe-2_4_1

Release tags are set by the release engineer who makes the releases.
Only he is to move these tags.

Release tags at the moment are

	pptp-linux-1_0_3-1
	pptp-linux-1_1_0-rc1
	pptp-linux-1_1_0-rc2
	pptp-linux-1_1_0-rc3
	ppp-mppe-2_4_0-3
	ppp-mppe-2_4_1-rc1
